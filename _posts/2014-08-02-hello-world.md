The prototypical "hello, world" post. Going to give a blog and site another go. This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's pretty cool and simple. It's a static site builder ruby gem. Write up your posts and pages in Markdown, run a build command and it churns out HTML with links. Has some basic layout and templating. Pretty nifty. The source for this page lives on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dankraus/dskrauscom).

I followed a simple guide to automate builds with Jekyll with git hooks written up by Digital Ocean. [Check it out](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-get-started-with-jekyll-on-an-ubuntu-vps).
