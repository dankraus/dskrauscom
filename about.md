I'm a web developer who loves to learn new stuff, likes to work across the full-stack, and experiment with Internet things.

My day-to-day has me working with ColdFusion (Railo), MySQL (MariaDB), JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS). I like playing with Ruby and Rails, NodeJS, and whatever else catch my interest. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dan-kraus/3/3b0/b12) for work experience.

I call Saint Louis, MO my home now but I lived and worked in Boston, MA and was born and raised on Long Island, NY. I'm a man of many hobbies from programming, to music, to video games, to Star Wars collecting.

I'm a member of the [R2 Builders Group](http://astromech.net) and [Saint Louis R2 Builders Group](https://facebook.com/r2stl). I built a 1:1 scale replica of R2-D2 mostly from scratch powered by Arduino with lights, sounds, and full remote control via an Xbox 360 controller. I frequent conventions and educational outreach programs for kids at events like at the Saint Louis Science Center and art and science fairs.

I'm currently working for Top of Mind Networks as a Software Developer working on a sweet app called Surefire.
